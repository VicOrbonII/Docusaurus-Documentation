    <>
     Having an open solution in our business process, we make our technological
     progress faster and more effecient when a potential million
     developers from around the world would contirbute to our project as oppose
     to having a tiny group of developers we have as a startup company.
     Your contribution will greatly help us build a more reliable, secure, cost-effecient, and flexible
     learning platform.
